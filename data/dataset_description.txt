The dataset describes the features and the related evaluations of robotic choreographies.

For each choreography we extract 19 features. 

For each choreography (i.e., each row), the following information is stored: 

- timeDuration: the seconds of the choreography duration;
- nMovements: the number of different movements of the choreography; 
- movementDifficulty: the degree of difficulty of the moves; the allowed levels (i.e., low, medium,high) are mapped to the interval ∈ [1, 3]; 
- robotSpeech: values 0 or 1 if the positions include the robot speech;
- acrobaticMovements: the level of acrobatic movements ∈ [1, 3];
- movementsRepetition: the level of movement repetitions ∈ [1, 3]; 
- musicGenre: the genre of the music;
- humanMovements: the level of human movement presence ∈ [1, 3]; 
- balance: the level of balance movements ∈ [1, 3]; 
- speed: the degree of movement speed ∈ [1, 3]; 
- bodyPartsCombination: the level of combinations involving different body parts ∈ [1, 3]; 
- musicBPM: the number of Beats Per Minute; 
- sameStartEndPosition: values 0 or 1 if the position (wrt the background) is the same at the end and at the beginning;
- headMovement: the level of combinations involving the head ∈ [1, 3]; 
- armsMovement: the level of combinations involving the arms ∈ [1, 3];
- handsMovement: the level of hands movement presence ∈ [1, 3]; 
- legsMovement: the level of legs movement presence ∈ [1, 3]; 
- feetMovement: the level of feet movement presence ∈ [1, 3].

The remaining colums are the evaluation targets. The evaluation phase is conducted by an audience by proposing a questionnaire. Each participant anonymously vote the proposed choreographies, providing a score for all targets on a Likert scale (from 1 to 5). The targets stored in the dataset are:
(1) Storytelling; 
(2) Rhythm; 
(3) Movement Technique; 
(4) Public Involvement; 
(5) Space Use; 
(6) Human Characterization; 
(7) Human Reproducibility.
