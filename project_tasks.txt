You need to create 7 regressors and 7 classifiers (one per evaluation target) to be trained on the data provided. Hint: use the Python libraries.

FOR THE REGRESSORS

- Step 1:

Create 7 different datasets with ALL the features and one single target. Make the same thing for all the remaining targets.

As an example, the dataset related to the first evaluation target will have these columns:

timeDuration, nMovements, movementsDifficulty, robotSpeech, acrobaticMovements, movementsRepetition, musicGenre, movementsTransitionsDuration, humanMovements, balance, speed, bodyPartsCombination, musicBPM, sameStartEndPositionPlace, headMovement, armsMovement, handsMovement, legsMovement, feetMovement, EvaluationChoreographyStoryTelling

the second will have the the second evaluation target in the last column EvaluationChoreographyRhythm instead of the first one and so on.

- Step 2: 

Train 7 regressors (one per evaluation target) by using the dataset and by using a state-of-the-art methodology to split it in train, test, and validation sets. Create plots and tables by measuring the metrics.

- Step 3:
Use the Python library Shap to individuate the features that most influence each prediction.

FOR THE CLASSIFIERS

- Step 1:

Create 7 different datasets with ALL the features and one single target. Make the same thing for all the remaining targets.

ATTENTION HERE: the classifier needs categorical targets --> you need to modify the dataset by transforming all the values between 1 and 3 in value 0, and all the values between 4 and 5 in value 1 in order to have a categorical dataset.

Then, with this new dataset, you can proceed as for the regressor tasks.

- Step 2: 

Train 7 classifiers (one per evaluation target) by using the dataset and by using a state-of-the-art methodology to split it in train, test, and validation sets (SAME OF THE REGRESSORS). Create plots and tables by measuring the metrics.

- Step 3:
Use the Python library Shap to individuate the features that most influence each prediction.

------------------------

How to split the work:
1) one person works on the regressors
2) one person works on the classifiers
3) one person works on the Shap library for both the regressors and the classifiers

Please, consider to be aware of the work af all your colleagues to be able to work in parallel and then discuss together the results.
